==============================================================================
1. Overview					*vimcomplete-overview*

Async autocompletion plugin written entirely in Vim9script.

==============================================================================
2. Features					*vimcomplete-features*

Words can be completed from various sources:

- Buffer words
- Dictionary files
- LSP (https://github.com/yegappan/lsp) client
- Snippets (vim-vsnip (https://github.com/hrsh7th/vim-vsnip) client)
- Ngrams (https://norvig.com/ngrams/) database
- Vim's omnifunc
- Path search
- Vim's abbreviations
- Vim9script language (similar to LSP)

Each completion source above can be enabled and customized per 'file type'
(`:h filetype`).

Completion items are sorted according to the following criteria:

- Recency (using a LRU cache)
- Length of item
- Priority
- Proximity of item (for buffer completion)
- Case match

==============================================================================
3. Requirements					*vimcomplete-requirements*

- Vim >= 9.0

==============================================================================
4. Installation					*vimcomplete-installation*

==============================================================================
5. Configuration				*vimcomplete-configuration*


The completion sources mentioned above, aside from buffer words and path
completion, are not enabled by default. This section provides instructions on
configuring both the completion sources and the completion engine itself.

Completion Engine Options~

This entity retrieves completion items from the enabled completion sources and
then displays the popup menu.

						    *vimcomplete-sortByLength*
sortByLength 		|Boolean| option. Sort completion items based on
 			length of autocompletion text. Default is |false|.

							 *vimcomplete-recency*
recency 		||Boolean| option. Show most recently chosen items at
			the top. Default is |true|.

						 *vimcomplete-recentItemCount*
recentItemCount 	|Number| option. Number of recent items to show at the
			top. Default is |5|.

						       *vimcomplete-matchCase*
matchCase 		|Boolean| option. Some provider modules return items
			that may not match the case of prefix being completed.
			Show items that match case with prefix at the top
			followed by other items. Default is |true|.

					    *vimcomplete-shuffleEqualPriority*
shuffleEqualPriority 	|Boolean| option. Items of equal priority modules are
			arranged such that the first item of all modules
			appear at the top. Default is set to |false|.

					   *vimcomplete-noNewlineInCompletion*
noNewlineInCompletion 	|Boolean| option. If false, <Enter> key in insert mode
			always inserts a newline whether it accepts selected item
			or if no item is selected. Otherwise, <CR> has default
			behavior (accept selected item and dismiss popup
			without inserting newline). Default is set to |false|.

							*vimcomplete-alwaysOn*
alwaysOn 		|Boolean| option. If |false| use `<c-space>`
			(control-space) to trigger completion. Default is
			|true|.

							*vimcomplete-showSource*
showSource 		|Boolean| option. Show the source where the completion
			item came from. Default is |true|.

							*vimcomplete-showKind*
showKind 		|Boolean| option. Show the type ('kind') of completion
			item returned by LSP server. Default is true.

						*vimcomplete-kindDisplayType*
kindDisplayType		String option. The 'kind' field of completion item
			can be displayed in a number of ways: as a single
			letter symbol (`symbol`), a single letter with descriptive
			text (`symboltext`), only text (`text`), an icon (`icon`),
			or icon with text (`icontext`). For showing icons you need
			a (patched font)[https://www.nerdfonts.com/].
			Default: `symboltext`.

						*vimcomplete-customCompletionKinds*
customCompletionKinds	Boolean option. Set this option to customize the 'kind'
			attribute (explained below). Default: `false`.

						*vimcomplete-completionKinds*
completionKinds		Dictionary option. Custom text to use when above option is
			set. Default: `{}`.

						*vimcomplete-customInfoWindow*
customInfoWindow	Change the look of default info popup window
			(explained below). Default: `true`.

Completion Provider General Options~

Following options are common to all completion provider modules.

						   *vimcomplete-module-enable*
enable 			|Boolean| option. |true| to enable the module. Default
			is |false| for all builtin modules except 'buffer'
			and 'path' completion.

						 *vimcomplete-module-maxCount*
maxCount 		|Number| option. Number of completion items made
			available from the module. Default is `10`.

						 *vimcomplete-module-priority*
priority 		|Number| option. Higher priority items are shown at
			the top. Default is `10`.

						*vimcomplete-module-filetypes*
filetypes 		|List|  List of file-types to enable a particular
			provider module. Default is `['*']` (all file-types),
			except for 'dictionary' module which is set to
			['text', 'markdown'].

Buffer Completion~

The current buffer, as well as other open buffers, are searched for completion
candidates using an asynchronous mechanism with a timeout. This approach
ensures that the completion engine is not slowed down by large buffers.

						  *vimcomplete-buffer-timeout*
timeout 		|Number| option. Maximum time spent searching for
			completion candidates in current buffer. Default is
			`100` milliseconds. If searching in multiple buffers
			additional 100 milliseconds is allocated. Search
			is aborted if any key is pressed.

				       *vimcomplete-buffer-searchOtherBuffers*
searchOtherBuffers 	|Boolean| option. Search other listed buffers. Default
			is |true|

					*vimcomplete-buffer-otherBuffersCount*
otherBuffersCount 	|Number| option. Maximum number of other listed
			buffers to search. Default is `3`.

				    *vimcomplete-buffer-completionMatcher*
completionMatcher 	|String| option. Enable fuzzy or case insensitive
			completion. Accepts one of the following values: `case`
			for case sensitive matching, `icase` for ignoring case
			while matching, and `fuzzy` for fuzzy match.
			Default is `icase`.

					      *vimcomplete-buffer-urlComplete*
urlComplete 		|Boolean| option. Complete http links in entirety.
			Useful when typing same url multiple times. Default is
			|false|.

					      *vimcomplete-buffer-envComplete*
envComplete 		|Boolean| option. Complete environment variables after
			letter `$`. Default is |false|.

Dictionary Completion~

The dictionary provider is capable of searching an arbitrary list of words
placed one per line in a text file. These words can encompass any non-space
characters, and the file doesn't necessarily need to be sorted. This feature
presents various opportunities. For instance, you can create a dictionary akin
to [Pydiction](https://github.com/vim-scripts/Pydiction), enabling the
completion of keywords, functions, and method names for any programming
language. Moreover, it can efficiently search a sorted dictionary using binary
search.

Unsorted dictionaries are searched in linear time `O(n)`, but they tend to
perform acceptably well for file sizes below 3MB (performance might vary
depending on your system).

Additionally, the dictionary files can include comments.

					*vimcomplete-dictionary-sortedDict*
sortedDict 	|Boolean| option. `true` if the dictionary file is sorted,
		`false` otherwise. This option affects both performance and
		correctness. Take care to set it correctly. Searching is case
		sensitive. Default: `true`.

					*vimcomplete-dictionary-commentStr*
commentStr 	|String| option. Any lines beginning with this string is
		ignored. Default: `---`.

					*vimcomplete-dictionary-onlyWords*
onlyWords 	Boolean option. Set this to `true` if both the prefix you are
		trying to complete and the dictionary contain alphanumeric
		characters only (text files). For programming language
		dictionaries it should be set to `false`, since they can contain
		characters like `@`, `.`, `(`, etc. Default: `false`.

					*vimcomplete-dictionary-matcher*
matcher 	String option. This option is active only when `onlyWords` is
		`true` (text files) and `sortedDict` is false. Accepted values are
		'case' (case sensitive) and 'ignorecase'. Default: `case`.

Further information about setting up configurations will be available later.
Nonetheless, here is a sample configuration specifically targeting the
dictionary source.

Dictionary files can be configured individually for each 'filetype' (`:h
filetype`). In the provided sample, the dictionary module is enabled for
filetypes 'python' and 'text'. The Vim option `dictionaries` is appropriately
set. Moreover, specific dictionary options are defined for each respective
filetype.

>
	vim9script
	var dictproperties = {
	    python: { sortedDict: false },
	    text: { sortedDict: true }
	}
	var vcoptions = {
	    dictionary: {
	        enable: true,
	        priority: 11,
	        filetypes: ['python', 'text'],
	        properties: dictproperties
	    },
	}
	autocmd VimEnter * g:VimCompleteOptionsSet(vcoptions)
	autocmd FileType text set dictionary+=/usr/share/dict/words
	autocmd FileType python set dictionary=$HOME/.vim/data/pythondict
```

> [TIP]
> For completing English words, you can utilize
> [ngram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram) completion as outlined below,
> or opt for a custom dictionary containing frequently used words. The default
> dictionary that comes pre-installed with Linux or MacOS encompasses numerous
> infrequently used words.

LSP Completion~

This source obtains autocompletion items from the
LSP client (https://github.com/yegappan/lsp).

> [IMPORTANT]
> Please install the [LSP client](https://github.com/yegappan/lsp) separately.

					*vimcomplete-lsp-keywordOnly*
keywordOnly 	Boolean option. If `true` completion will be triggered after any
		keyword character as defined by the file type (`:h 'iskeyword'`).
		`false` will trigger completion after non-keywords like `.` (for
		instance). Default: `false`.

					*vimcomplete-lsp-filetypes*
filetypes 	List option. This option need not be specified. If this option
		is not specified or is empty, completion items are sourced
		for any file type for which LSP is configured. Otherwise, items
		are sourced only for listed file types. Default: Not specified.

Vsnip Completion~

This source provides snippet completion from
[vim-vsnip](https://github.com/hrsh7th/vim-vsnip).

> [IMPORTANT]
> Please install the following separately.
> - [vim-vsnip](https://github.com/hrsh7th/vim-vsnip)
> - [vim-vsnip-integ](https://github.com/hrsh7th/vim-vsnip-integ)
> Optional:
> - [friendly-snippets](https://github.com/rafamadriz/friendly-snippets)


					*vimcomplete-vsnip-adaptNonKeyword*
adaptNonKeyword 	Boolean option. (Experimental) When completing snippets
			starting with non-keywords, say '#i' for instance,
			adjust completion such that they are compatible with
			items starting with keywords like 'i' (returned by LSP,
			for instance). Default is `false`.

> [NOTE]
> The `<Tab>` key facilitates movement within a snippet. When a snippet is
> active, the popup completion menu won't open. However, the popup window will
> activate upon reaching the final stop within the snippet. If you wish to
> navigate backward within the snippet using `<S-Tab>`, you can dismiss the
> popup by using `CTRL-E`.


Ngrams Completion~

This source is kept as a separate plugin since it includes large database
files. Please see
**[ngram-complete](https://github.com/girishji/ngram-complete.vim)** for
installation and usage instructions.

Omnifunc Completion~

This source completes items emitted by the function set in `omnifunc` (`:h
'omnifunc'`).

Vim provides language based autocompletion through Omni completion for many
languages (see `$VIMRUNTIME/autoload`). This is a lightweight alternative to
using LSP.

ccomplete.vim 		C
csscomplete.vim 	HTML / CSS
htmlcomplete.vim 	HTML
javascriptcomplete.vim 	Javascript
phpcomplete.vim 	PHP
pythoncomplete.vim 	Python
rubycomplete.vim 	Ruby
syntaxcomplete.vim 	from syntax highlighting
xmlcomplete.vim 	XML (uses files in the xml directory)

Vim sets the `omnifunc` option automatically when file type is detected.

Also, any user defined `omnifunc` can also be used for autocompletion.

> [CAUTION]
> Disable the [LSP Completion]() when using omnifunc.

Path Completion~

Both relative and absolute path names are completed.

bufferRelativePath 	|Boolean| option. Interpret relative paths as being
			relative to the directory of the current buffer. By
			default, paths are interpreted as relative to the
			current working directory (see |:pwd|). Default is
			|true|.

groupDirectoriesFirst	Group directories before files (like linux's 'ls
			--group-directories-first'). Default is |false|.

showPathSeparatorAtEnd	Show path separator (`/` in unix) at the end of
			directory entry. Default: |false|.

> [NOTE]
> Path completion activates when there is a `/` (`\` for Windows) or `.` in
> the word before the cursor. To autocomplete deeper in a directory type `/`
> at the end.

Abbreviations Completion~

Abbreviations (`:h abbreviations`) are completed based on the `id`.

Vim9script Language Completion~

This source completes Vim9 script function names, arguments, variables,
reserved words and the like. Enable this if you are developing a Vim plugin or
configuring a non-trivial .vimrc.

Configure Options~

Options are configured using global function `g:VimCompleteOptionsSet()`. Here
is an example of how you can enable and configure completion modules. Not all
options are shown here, please see tables above for all available options.
>
	vim9script
	var options = {
	    completor: { shuffleEqualPriority: true },
	    buffer: { enable: true, priority: 10, urlComplete: true, envComplete: true },
	    abbrev: { enable: true, priority: 10 },
	    lsp: { enable: true, priority: 10, maxCount: 5 },
	    omnifunc: { enable: false, priority: 8, filetypes: ['python', 'javascript'] },
	    vsnip: { enable: true, priority: 9 },
	    vimscript: { enable: true, priority: 11 },
	    ngram: {
	        enable: true,
	        priority: 10,
	        bigram: false,
	        filetypes: ['text', 'help', 'markdown'],
	        filetypesComments: ['c', 'cpp', 'python'],
	    },
	}
	autocmd VimEnter * g:VimCompleteOptionsSet(options)

Tab Completion~

`<Tab>` and `<S-Tab>` keys can be mapped to select autocompletion items. By
default `<C-N>` and `<C-P>` select the menu items.
>
	g:vimcomplete_tab_enable = 1

Highlight Groups ~

You can use `Pmenu`, `PmenuThumb`, `PmenuSbar`, `PmenuSel`, `PmenuKind`,
`PmenuKindSel`, `PmenuExtra` and `PmenuExtraSel` highlight groups to alter the
appearance of the popup menu.

Info Popup Window ~

Vim's completion system opens an additional popup window next to the selected
item if the item has additional info that need to be displayed. If you prefer
to keep the default look of this window set `customInfoWindow` to `false`. Set
it to `true` to see a more refined border. If you prefer to customize this
window further use `g:VimCompleteInfoPopupOptionsSet()`. It takes a dictionary
of popup window options like `borderchars`, `borderhighlight` and
`popuphighlight`. See |popup_create-arguments|.

==============================================================================
6. Enable and Disable 		*vimcomplete_disable* *vimcomplete-enable*

Autocompletion is enabled by default. You can enable or disable the plugin
anytime using commands.
>
	:VimCompleteEnable
	:VimCompleteDisable

To start Vim with autocompletion disabled, set the following variable.

```
g:vimcomplete_enable_by_default = true
```

You can selectively enable autocompletion for specified file types. For
example, enable autocompletion for `c`, `cpp`, `python`, `vim`, `text`, and
`markdown` files.

>
	:VimCompleteEnable c cpp python vim text markdown

`VimCompleteEnable` takes space separated list of file types as an argument. If
no argument is specified, then autocompletion is enabled for all file types. 

If you are using a plugin manager like |vim-plug| use the following in
$HOME/.vimrc.

```
autocmd VimEnter * VimCompleteEnable c cpp python vim text markdown
```

When Vim is started without any arguments or a new buffer is created with
:bufnew, it opens an unnamed buffer. This buffer is not associated with any
_file type_. To enable/disable autocompletion on this buffer use the following
variable. It is set by default.

```
g:vimcomplete_noname_buf_enable = true
```

==============================================================================
7. List Completion Sources 				*vimcomplete-list*

Following command shows which completion modules are active for a current
buffer,
>
	:VimCompleteCompletors

==============================================================================
8. Extensions					*vimcomplete-extensions*

A good place to start is by looking at the implementation of external
plugins, like
- ngrams (https://github.com/girishji/ngram-complete.vim)
- ngrams-viewer (https://github.com/girishji/ngramview-complete.vim)

The Completion engine uses similar interface as Vim's |complete-functions|
except that the function is called in three different ways (instead of two):

- First the function is called to find the start of the text to be completed.
- Next the function is called to check if completion candidates are available.
- Later the function is called to actually find the matches.

The first and last invocation are identical to Vim's |complete-functions|. On
the second invocation the arguments are:

- findstart: 2
- base:	empty

The function must return |true| or |false| indicating whether completion
candidates are ready. Only when this return value is |true| will the function
invoked for the third time to get the actual matches. This step is necessary
for asynchronous completion.

It does not matter what the name of the completion function is but it
should take two arguments `findstart: Number` and `base: String` and return
`<any>`. This function should be registered with completion engine by calling
`vimcompletor.Register()` function. The `User` event of type
`VimCompleteLoaded` can be used to time the registration.

When the user sets options through Vim configuration file a `User` event with
type `VimCompleteOptionsChanged` is issued. The plugin should register for
this event and update its internal state appropriately.

==============================================================================
9. Custom Completion Kinds			*vimcomplete-customize*

Each item returned by the LSP server has a type associated with it, which can
be displayed on the popup menu. To customize , you need to use the option
`customCompletionKinds` and set all custom kinds in the `completionKinds`.
This table has all default LSP kinds:

Kind|Description
----|-----------
 t  | Text
 m  | Method
 f  | Function
 C  | Constructor
 F  | Field
 v  | Variable
 c  | Class
 i  | Interface
 M  | Module
 p  | Property
 u  | Unit
 V  | Value
 e  | Enum
 k  | Keyword
 S  | Snippet
 C  | Color
 f  | File
 r  | Reference
 F  | Folder
 E  | EnumMember
 d  | Constant
 s  | Struct
 E  | Event
 o  | Operator
 T  | TypeParameter
 B  | Buffer
 O  | Option
 a  | Abbreviation
 e  | EnvVariable
 U  | URL
 c  | Command

Last four kinds are not associated with LSP.

For example, if you want to change the "Method" kind to the kind "method()":
>
    vim9script
    g:VimCompleteOptionsSet({ Completor: {
        customCompletionKinds: true,
        completionKinds: {
            "Method": "method()"
        }
    })

    In the completion popup, will show something like this: >

        var file = new File()

        file.cre
            | create                method() |
            | createIfNotExists     method() |
            | ...                 |
